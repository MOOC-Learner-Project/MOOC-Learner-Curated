# Takes a destination dir and a list of track log
# files. Transforms the log files, and places the
# resulting .sql and .csv files in the destination dir.
# Invokes json2sql.py with '-t csv', causing one
# .sql file for each log file to be created, plus
# as many .csv files for each log file as there are
# tables. The .sql file contains statements that loads 
# the .csv files. The loading is done after transform
# via executeCSVLoad.sh
#
# Assumes that json2sql.py is in same directory
# as this script. But this script can be called
# from anywhere.
