# Pipe the screen names to the script that will 
# read each screen name from stdin, and output its
# anonymized version to stdout. Pass this stream
# of hashes to the bash 'paste' command, which pairs
# each hash with its corresponding screen name from
# the same tmp file we used to generate the hashes.
# Remove all-empty lines in the sed command. Finally,
# replace the tab used to separate the columns
# screenName and hashValue to a comma:
cat $tmpScreenNames | $thisScriptDir/makeAnonScreenName.py - |  paste $tmpScreenNames - | sed '/^\s*$/d' | sed 's/\t/,/'

# Trap ensures that the tmp file is removed even
# on error:
